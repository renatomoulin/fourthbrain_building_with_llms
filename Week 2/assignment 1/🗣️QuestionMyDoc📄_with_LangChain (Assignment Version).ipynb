Gruyère: A Swiss cheese with a nutty and slightly sweet taste, often used in fondue and gratins.\n\n4. Brie de Meaux: A soft, creamy French cheese with a bloomy rind and a buttery flavor.\n\n5. Comté: A French cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk, aged for several months or even years, resulting in a complex and nutty flavor.\n\n6. Stilton: A traditional English blue cheese, known for its crumbly texture and rich, mellow flavor.\n\n7. Manchego: A Spanish cheese made from sheep's milk, aged for varying lengths of time, offering a range of flavors from mild to intense.\n\n8. Mozzarella di Bufala: An Italian cheese made from buffalo milk, prized for its soft and elastic texture, often used in Caprese salads and pizza.\n\n9. Camembert: A soft, creamy French cheese with a bloomy rind, known for its earthy aroma and buttery flavor.\n\n10. Cheddar: A popular cheese originating from England, with a wide range of flavors and textures, from mild and creamy to sharp and crumbly.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are countless other exceptional cheeses from different regions around the world.
